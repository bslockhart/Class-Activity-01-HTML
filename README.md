## üí° Hints
How can you use header elements to define the most important heading and the subheaders? How does using different header elements impact the size of the text?
Refer to the [Full-Stack Blog HTML Cheatsheet](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/html/html-cheatsheet).

## üèÜ Bonus

* What are the advantages of using semantic HTML elements?
Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
